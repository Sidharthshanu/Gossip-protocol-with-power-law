HEAD
1. Config File should be empty
2. Run Seeds after that by creating different seeds in different terminals
3. run the peers after this in seperate terminals



NOTE: If you are running it locally , then all peers and seeds should have access of the config file.
if you are running it across networks , the config file shall be same for all and the config file is outside the scope of seeds to change non locally.
